## IReceivedJoinRequestStore interface

This is a store that contains all join requests that other users have sent, requesting to join conversations where the current user is an owner.

A join request can be accepted by adding the requesting user as a member in the conversaion.

When a join request is accepted by any eligible receiver, or explicitly ignored by the current user, the request is removed from this collection.
