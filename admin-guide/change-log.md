The legacy SDKs will have a reduced support starting in **January 2022** and will no longer be supported in **March 2022**. At this date, you will still be able to use the legacy SDKs, however please consider migrating to the new BDKs for faster development, higher reliability & always benefit from the new features.

At this date you will still be able to use the SDK, however, please consider our SDKs in Java, Python or .Net if you prefer to benefit from a better support.
