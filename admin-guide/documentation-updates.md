### Documentation Changes 20.6 \(1.60\)

### **General updates**

The following list shows the pages that have been updated:

* Symphony Elements:
  * [Available Components](../building-bots-on-symphony/symphony-elements/available-elements/): added information about using Elements with cards.
  * Text Field, Text Area and Masked Text Field: added the new `pattern` and `pattern-error-message`attributes. Also, the gif images have been updated in order to show the new design of the error messages.
  * Buttons: added the new `class` attribute which allows bot developers to use the new palette of colors `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary` and `destructive`. The classes `primary-destructive` and `secondary-destructive` are however deprecated.
  * [Regular Expressions - Regex](../building-bots-on-symphony/symphony-elements/regular-expressions-regex.md): new page added in order to help bot developers to securely validate input data. This page describes what a regular expression is \(shortened as regex\) and how to add the validation to Symphony Elements.
