# Documentation Updates

Our documentation is continually updated with new topics, and corrections or clarifications made to existing content. Check back every now and then, to see what is new!

Also, visit the [Change Log](change-log.md) to know more about the major Symphony updates.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since November 2021, the developer portal is not divided in release versions any more and it contains latest information on a single environment. The change logs are gathered as subpages of each impacted product so that developers still have access to its history and know which features are introduced in their new version of any Symphony product impacting the developer journey.

_Please note that our REST API reference documentation is still divided into release versions, and you can navigate through these to have the adhoc endpoints request/payload rules to your deployed Agent/SBE version._
{% endhint %}

In this page, you will find the main updates/announcements of the developers portal documentation changes, as well as the historical changes corresponding to each version from our old documentation system.
