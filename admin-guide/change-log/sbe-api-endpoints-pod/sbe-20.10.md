# SBE - 20.10

## SBE API changes

### **New APIs**

No SBE API endpoint was created in Symphony version 20.10.

### **Updated APIs**

The behavior of some API endpoints has been changed to ignore unexpected parameters. Please keep in mind that unexpected parameters are not officially supported and may result in an error in a future version.

### **Deprecated APIs**

* [Get Message IDs by Timestamp](https://developers.symphony.com/restapi/v20.10/reference#get-message-ids-by-timestamp) is deprecated starting with version 20.10. Please reach out to your Technical Account Manager or Solution Architect for more information.
