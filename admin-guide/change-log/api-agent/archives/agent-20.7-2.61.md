## Agent Changes

### Agent 2.61.0

* Fixed issues in the conversion of the emoji shortcode from messageML to presentationML.
* Improved the [Health Check Extended v3](https://developers.symphony.com/v20.7/restapi/reference#health-check-extended-v3) API endpoint to return the authType field, showing if the Agent authentication is configured to use RSA or Certificate.
* [Message Create v4](https://developers.symphony.com/restapi/v20.7/reference#create-message-v4): Fixed issue when sending a message that mentions an external user by his/her email.
* Properly return a 451 error code when a message sent is blocked by DLP (Data Loss Prevention) instead of returning a 400 error code.
* More secured way to provide Authentication credentials for the Agent: RSA private key for the agentservice user and ceservice user can be passed through VM parameters. For more information, refer to [Agent 2.X and above Installation](../../../agent-guide/agent-2.x-and-above-installation.md).
