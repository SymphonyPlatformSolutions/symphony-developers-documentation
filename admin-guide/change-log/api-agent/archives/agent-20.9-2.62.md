### Agent 2.62.0

* Support of new Elements features (Expandable Card, Label and Tooltip)
  * Expandable card: new Expandable card with updated display. The card can have three different states, that can be set by the developer: collapsed, expanded but cropped, fully expanded. _See how to use the `expandable-card` tag in_ [_Content Grouping_](../../../../bots/messages/overview-of-messageml/messageml-basic-format-tags/content-grouping.md) _specifications._
  * Label: it is now possible to set a Label associated with an element (text-field, masked text-field, textarea, dropdown, person selector) so the user can understand better the field meaning. This way the placeholder can focus on providing a hint of the expected format. _See more details on how to use it in the documentation for specific elements supporting the `label` attribute under the_ [_Interactive Elements Forms_](../../../../bots/messages/overview-of-messageml/symphony-elements-1/) _section._
  * Tooltip: it is now possible to add a hint associated with an element (for text-field, masked text-field, textarea, dropdown, person selector) to provide more detailed information to the user on the meaning or expected value of an Element. _See more details on how to use it in the documentation for specific elements supporting the `title` attribute under the_ [_Interactive Elements Forms_](../../../../bots/messages/overview-of-messageml/symphony-elements-1/) _section._
* The following API endpoint has been created:
  * [Blast Message](https://developers.symphony.com/restapi/v20.9/reference#blast-message) to send a message to a list of streams (room, IM, MIM).
* Removed a duplicated definition in swagger and moved some endpoints definition to the right swagger repository (see swagger link above)
* Upgrade of library dependencies
