## Agent Release Cycle

#### Release cycle

The Agent is released monthly, and the version number follows a year.month.patch convention. Occasionally, a release may be skipped.

#### Long Term Support (LTS) versions

The releases of March, June, September and December are Long Term Support versions (e.g. releases named yy.3, yy.6, yy.9, and yy.12) and are supported for a year.

The other versions don't benefit from our Long Term Support and are out of support as soon as a new LTS version is released.&#x20;

#### Compatibility with SBE versions

The **last four LTS versions are supported** and are always compatible with the production supported SBE versions.
