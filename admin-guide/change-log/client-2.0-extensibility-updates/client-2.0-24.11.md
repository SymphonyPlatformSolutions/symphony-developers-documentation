# Client 2.0 - 24.11

**Desktop Interoperability (FDC3)**

* FDC3 Action buttons: Ability to **broadcast a context** from a FDC3 action button in a chat. Until now, only intents were supported.
* SendChatMessage / StartChat: Ability to send a message **without displaying a confirm modal**. A toast notification is displayed to the user. Thanks to this, users have one less click required to send a message on Symphony.
