# Client 2.0 - 25.02

**Desktop Interoperability (FDC3)**

* Added Support for **OpenFin** (Beta). OpenFin is only available as Beta for now, and is qualified for UAT environments only. Configuring OpenFin requires a **specific version of our Symphony Desktop App (SDA)**, and needs to be activated on your environment, until it is qualified for Production. More information is available in [#configure-for-openfin](../../../embedded-modules/desktop-interoperability/configuration-guide/configure-with-the-native-connector.md#configure-for-openfin "mention").
