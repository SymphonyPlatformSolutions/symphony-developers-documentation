# Client 2.0 - 25.02

**Desktop Interoperability (FDC3)**

* Added support for **Here Core (previously known as OpenFin Workspace)**. Here Core is only available as Beta for now, and is qualified for UAT environments only. Configuring Here core requires a **specific version of our Symphony Desktop App (SDA)**, and needs to be activated on your environment, until it is qualified for Production. More information is available in [configure-here-core.md](../../../embedded-modules/desktop-interoperability/configuration-guide/configure-here-core.md "mention").
