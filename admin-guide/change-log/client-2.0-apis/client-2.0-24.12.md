# Client 2.0 - 24.12

**Desktop Interoperability (FDC3)**

* FDC3 Action buttons: Ability to [**broadcast a context**](../../../embedded-modules/desktop-interoperability/fdc3-intents/message-format.md#fdc3-action-buttons) from a FDC3 action button in a chat. Until now, only intents were supported.
* SendChatMessage / StartChat: Ability to send a message **without displaying a** [**confirm modal**](../../../embedded-modules/desktop-interoperability/fdc3-intents/#start-chat). A toast notification is displayed to the user. Thanks to this, users have one less click required to send a message on Symphony.
