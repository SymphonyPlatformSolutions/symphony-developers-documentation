# Client 2.0 - 20.5

* With Symphony v20.5, the usage of cards with Symphony Elements became possible. For more information, refer to [Content Grouping](../../../../bots/messages/overview-of-messageml/messageml-basic-format-tags/content-grouping.md) and [Interactive Elements Forms](../../../../bots/messages/overview-of-messageml/symphony-elements-1/).
* Now, in read-only rooms, Symphony Elements appear disabled for non-owner users (those with read-only permission).
* [Import Message V4](https://developers.symphony.com/restapi/reference#import-message-v4): Fixed an issue where imported messages were showing the wrong timestamp input.
