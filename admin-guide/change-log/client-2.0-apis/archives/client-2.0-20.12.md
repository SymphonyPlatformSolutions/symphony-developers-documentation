# Client 2.0 - 20.12

Please look at the Client 2.0 release notes to see which features have been introduced in the new Client, such as features for Extension Apps, or eventual Elements changes. Some of them are documented below:

* Extension API: it is now possible to add a default value to the [share service](../../../../ext-apps/overview-of-extension-api/extension-api-services/share-service.md)
* Fixed display bugs of Elements: removed extra spacing at the bottom of forms, as well as more general bugs
