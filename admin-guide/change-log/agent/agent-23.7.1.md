## Agent Changes

### Agent 23.7.1

* Fixed security vulnerabilities.
* Changed how the limits on the size of the messages are enforced. **This change has no effect until a future SBE release is deployed**, where the limits on the size of the messages will be increased (total number of characters, number of tokens, number of entities). This improvement will be documented in the release notes of the corresponding SBE release.&#x20;
