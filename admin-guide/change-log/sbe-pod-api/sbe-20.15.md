# SBE - 20.15

## SBE API changes

### **Updated APIs**

* [Signals](https://developers.symphony.com/restapi/reference/create-signal): As it is now possible to create cashtags and hashtags that contain **spaces**, it is also possible to subscribe to signals based on tags that contain spaces as well. All Signals endpoints are impacted.
