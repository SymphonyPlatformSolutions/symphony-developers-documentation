## **Module 1: Symphony Development Fundamentals**

Covers the Symphony essentials including UI features, Architecture, Security, and Symphony APIs.

## Module 2: Developing Bots and Apps on Symphony

Takes a deeper dive into Symphony APIs and involves hands-on examples where you get to build using our latest developer tool, the Symphony Bot Developer Kit \(BDK\)

## How It works

Certification involves taking Module 1 and Module 2 of the Certification training program, and then passing the Certification exam.  The course should take approximately 3.5 hours following by the exam.

* The program is free and open to developers with knowledge of programming languages such as JavaScript, Python and Java.
* Knowledge of the Symphony platform is not required, but exercises will require developers to access a Symphony environment.
* Symphony will provide a limited, shared sandbox environment for those who do not have a company test environment.
