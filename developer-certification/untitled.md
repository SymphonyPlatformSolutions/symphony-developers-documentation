## Become a Certified Symphony Developer

Becoming a Symphony Certified Developer is a great way to validate your Symphony skills. When you become certified, you join an elite group of developers, and boost your career as demand for Symphony experts continues to grow!

Check out our training center here:

## **Module 1: Symphony Development Fundamentals**

Covers the Symphony essentials including UI features, Architecture, Security, and Symphony APIs.

## Module 2: Developing Bots and Apps on Symphony

Takes a deeper dive into Symphony APIs, including hands-on examples built using our latest developer tool, the Symphony Bot Developer Kit \(BDK\)

## How It works

Certification involves taking Module 1 and Module 2 of the certification training program, and then passing the certification exam. The course should take approximately 3.5 hours followed by the exam.

* The program is free and open to developers with knowledge of programming languages such as JavaScript, Python and Java.
* Knowledge of the Symphony platform is not required, but exercises will require developers to access a Symphony environment.
* Symphony will provide a limited, shared sandbox environment for those who do not have a company test environment.
