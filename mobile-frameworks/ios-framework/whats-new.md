### Meeting framework

That will reduce the size of your application binary.

@property (nonatomic) BOOL disableAccessToPhotoGallery;

\
Set **`disableAccessToPhotoGallery`** to YES if you would like to block your users from attaching photos from their camera roll to messages sent within the application.\
Default is NO\
App config key : disable\_access\_to\_photo\_gallery

### New policies available

```
@property (nonatomic) BOOL allowOpeningEmailAddress;
```

\
Set **`allowOpeningEmailAddress`** to YES if you would like to permit your users to open email address in an external application\
App config key : enable\_opening\_email\_address\
_Default is YES_Objective-C

```
@property (nonatomic) BOOL enforcePincode;
```

\
Set **`enforcePincode`** to YES if you would like the Symphony application to force the user to define a 6 digit pin code on launch\
If enabled, the "Turn Off Pincode" control in the Settings view will be hidden.

Note: This option overrides `disablePincode`.\
If both `disablePincode` and `enforcePincode` are enabled, `enforcePincode` wins and the user will be forced to setup a 6 digit pin code.\


If the user is already logged in from a previous version of the app or if `enforcePincode` was disabled when the user logged in, a prompt is presented to ask the user to define the pin code on launch\
App config key : enforce\_pin\
_Default is NO_Objective-C

```
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSNumber *refreshTokenPeriod;
```

\
Define the `refreshTokenPeriod` in hours\
_If not defined the default value of 24h will be used_\
App config key : refresh\_token\_period

### Symphony logger

You can add information to Symphony logs by using:

```
[[BBLogger sharedInstance] log:@"My log"];
[[BBLogger sharedInstance] logFormat:@"My log %@", my_object];
```
