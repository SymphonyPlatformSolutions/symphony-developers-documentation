# Creating a Bot User

In order to create a bot and begin your development journey, you must first create a bot user, also known as a service account. You can only do this yourself if you are a pod administrator on your Symphony pod. Otherwise, please seek assistance from your pod administrator or your internal IT Service Desk if you are unsure who to contact.

## Create a Bot User

1. Navigate to your Symphony admin console for your Pod \(for example, [https://mycompany.symphony.com/?admin\](https://mycompany.symphony.com/?admin\)\) and login with your credentials.
2. Select '**CREATE AN ACCOUNT**' from the left hand navigation.
