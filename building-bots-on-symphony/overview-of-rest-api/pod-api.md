## Symphony Pod APIs <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/symphony-pod.png" alt="" data-size="line">

The Symphony Pod API is used to build tools in order to manage and administer Symphony for your organization. The following guide includes API collections that exist on the Pod:

## Session Authenticate API <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/symphony-api.png" alt="" data-size="line">

In order to access Pod API endpoints, bots must be authenticated with the Pod. To do so, a Bot must call the [Session Authenticate endpoint](https://developers.symphony.com/restapi/reference#rsa-session-authenticate).

If successful, the Pod API returns a Session Token which is valid for up to two weeks. This Session Token must be passed along with every subsequent Pod API request. You can read more about Authentication and Token management here:
