# Getting Started With Headless Bots

## Build Your First Bot

Symphony provides a number of tools to help streamline bot development:

## BDK 2.0 <a href="bdk-2-0" id="bdk-2-0"></a>

BDK 2.0 is a library of tools and intelligent API bindings that provides an ultra simplified configuration and authentication setup, intuitive message and room management, customizable message templating, and a new activities API that makes it easy to facilitate bot workflows.

For a deeper dive into the BDK 2.0 and its offerings, continue here:

### Configure your Bot for BDK 2.0 Development <a href="configure-your-bot-for-bdk-2-0-development" id="configure-your-bot-for-bdk-2-0-development"></a>

Generating and configuring your bot project has never been easier. Before moving on to one of our dedicated bot tutorials, quickly generate and configure your bot using the BDK 2.0!

{% endcontent-ref %}

## BDK 1.0

The BDK 1.0 or Bot Developer Kit comprises of three development tools for more advanced bot and extension app development.

### Bot SDK

The Bot SDK is a Java specific SDK that provides all the basic support as our other SDKs including authentication handlers, centralized configuration, convenient error handling, datafeed management, and API bindings. In addition, the Bot SDK provides development best practices for building enterprise grade, financial applications.

Learn more about the Bot SDK here:

{% content-ref url="../../../developer-tools/developer-tools/bdk-2.0/bdk-1.0/bot-sdk.md" %}
[bot-sdk.md](../../../developer-tools/developer-tools/bdk-2.0/bdk-1.0/bot-sdk.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### CLI Tool

The CLI tool allows you to generate code scaffolds for Symphony Bots and Applications. Through the command line tool, developers can bootstrap their projects, adds command handlers and message templates, and manage project dependencies.

Learn more about the CLI Tool here:

{% content-ref url="../../../developer-tools/developer-tools/bdk-2.0/bdk-1.0/cli-tool.md" %}
[cli-tool.md](../../../developer-tools/developer-tools/bdk-2.0/bdk-1.0/cli-tool.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### UI Toolkit

The UI Toolkit is a library of react components that helps you build complex frontend applications quickly. The library contains layout guides, forms, input fields, complex financial charts, and is already compatible with Symphony's UI theme.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: In the current version of the BDK, the UI Toolkit is designed to help build Extension Applications only and is not relevant for Bot development
{% endhint %}

You can learn more about the UI Toolkit here:

{% content-ref url="../../../developer-tools/developer-tools/bdk-2.0/bdk-1.0/ui-toolkit.md" %}
[ui-toolkit.md](../../../developer-tools/developer-tools/bdk-2.0/bdk-1.0/ui-toolkit.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Configure your Bot for BDK 1.0 Development

The next step to building a bot using the BDK is to configure your bot:

{% content-ref url="../../configuration/configure-your-bot-for-bdk.md" %}
[configure-your-bot-for-bdk.md](../../configuration/configure-your-bot-for-bdk.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Afterwards, continue building and running your Headless Bot here:

{% content-ref url="../../tutorials/bdk/building-a-headless-bot-using-the-bdk.md" %}
[building-a-headless-bot-using-the-bdk.md](../../tutorials/bdk/building-a-headless-bot-using-the-bdk.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
