# Getting Started With Headless Bots

## Build Your First Bot

Symphony provides a number of tools to help streamline Bot development:

## Bot Developer Kit

The Bot Developer Kit comprises of three development tools for more advanced Symphony Bot and Extension App development.

### Bot SDK

The Bot SDK is a Java specific SDK that provides all the basic support as our other SDKs including authentication handlers, centralized configuration, convenient error handling, Datafeed management, and API bindings. In addition, the Bot SDK provides development best practices for building enterprise grade, financial applications.

Learn more about the Bot SDK here:

### CLI Tool

The CLI tool allows you to generate code scaffolds for Symphony Bots and Applications. Through the command line tool, developers can bootstrap their projects, adds command handlers and message templates, and manage project dependencies.

Learn more about the CLI Tool here:

### UI Toolkit

The UI Toolkit is a library of react components that helps you build complex frontend applications quickly. The library contains layout guides, forms, input fields, complex financial charts, and is already compatible with Symphony's UI theme.

Note: In the current version of the BDK, the UI Toolkit is designed to help build Extension Applications only and is not relevant for Bot development

## Configure your Bot for BDK Development

The next step to building a Bot using the BDK is to configure your Bot:
