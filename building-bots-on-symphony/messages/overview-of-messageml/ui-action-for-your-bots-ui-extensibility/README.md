# Extensibility UI Actions

With Actions, MessageML allows your bots to send messages containing components that have UI extensibility capabilities, such as opening another chatroom or start a conversation with a specific user for your Symphony users.

These functionalities are gathered in the subpages you can find below.

## MessageML tag

The UI Actions are represented by the **`<ui-action>` **tag, that can be associated with different attributes, such as `trigger`, `action`, or other more specific attributes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Please note that UI-Actions are not rendered on mobile_
{% endhint %}
