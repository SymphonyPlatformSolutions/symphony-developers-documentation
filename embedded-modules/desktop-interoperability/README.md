Symphony now interoperates with your local apps using the FDC3 standard to accelerate workflows on your desktop.

You can see a live demo of desktop interop in the recording of our Innovate London 2022 conference. The demo starts at 13'.

{% hint style="info" %}
To interoperate with local apps using the FDC3 APIs, a desktop integration platform, such as Finsemble, Glue42 or OpenFin, needs to be running on the user machines.\
Symphony aims to be platform-agnostic, however, as of today, only [Finsemble ](https://cosaic.io/finsemble/)and [Glue42 ](https://glue42.com/enterprise/)are supported.
{% endhint %}

_Symphony is a Finos gold member and an active maintainer of the FDC3 standard._
