# Desktop interoperability

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

Symphony now interoperates with your local apps using the FDC3 standard to accelerate workflows on your desktop.

Learn more on [FDC3](https://fdc3.finos.org/), the open standard for the financial desktop.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to interop with local apps using the FDC3 APIs, a desktop integration platform needs to be running on the user machines, such as Finsemble, Glue42 or OpenFin. \
Symphony aims to be agnostic to the platform, however as of today only [Finsemble ](https://cosaic.io/finsemble/)and [Glue42 ](https://glue42.com/enterprise/)are supported.
{% endhint %}

_Symphony is a gold member of Finos and an active maintainer of the FDC3 standard._
