# Desktop interoperability

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to use the FDC3 APIs, Symphony requires a desktop integration platform to be running on user machines, such as Finsemble, Glue42 or OpenFin. \
Symphony aims to be agnostic to the platform, however as of today only [Finsemble ](https://cosaic.io/finsemble/)and [Glue42 ](https://glue42.com/enterprise/)are supported.
