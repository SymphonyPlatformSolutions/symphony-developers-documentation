# Desktop interoperability

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png>)

Symphony Messaging now interoperates with your local apps using the FDC3 standard to accelerate workflows on your desktop.

{% hint style="info" %}
To interoperate with local apps using the FDC3 APIs, a desktop integration platform, such as interop.io, Here (formerly OpenFin) or Connectifi needs to be running on the user machines.\
Symphony Messaging aims to be platform-agnostic, but some features may not be available with all platforms.
{% endhint %}



You can see a live demo of desktop interop in the [recording of our Innovate London 2022](https://innovate.symphony.com/videos/3447) conference. The demo starts at 13'.
