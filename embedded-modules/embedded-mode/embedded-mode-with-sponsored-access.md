# Embedded Mode with Sponsored Access

## Symphony Sponsored Access offering

Symphony Sponsored Access allows Symphony partners to enable the users of their applications to collaborate on Symphony Messaging by adding those companies and users to the Symphony network. Partners can use these APIs to check if their application users are on Symphony Messaging and create accounts for them on Symphony Messaging if required.

See [Sponsored Access API](https://docs.developers.symphony.com/symphony-rest-api/symphony-channel-connect-rest-api) for more information on Sponsored Access and how to create accounts for users who need a new Symphony Messaging account.&#x20;

## Single Sign On support

Symphony Sponsored Access users can benefit from Single Sign On if it has been configured by the Partner that has onboarding them.

Similarly, standard Symphony Messaging users can benefit from Single Sign On if it has been configured by their admin.

If a user logs in Embedded Mode from your portal, they will be automatically redirected to either their company SSO or your SSO automatically.

## Bring your own Single Sign On

Users that you have onboarded on Symphony Messaging can also benefit from Single Sign On if your application can act as an identity provider using the Open ID connect (OIDC) or SAML protocols. Please reach out to us for more information.
