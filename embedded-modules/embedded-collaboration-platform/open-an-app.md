# Open an app

## Open an extension app with an appId

The `openApp` function exposed by the SDK allows you to open a module of an extension app in ECP.&#x20;

The extension app needs to be already installed for the user, and to have been preloaded by ECP, using the `allowedApps` setting. Please refer to [Support for extension applications](support-for-extension-applications.md) for information on preloading an app.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Only extension applications that add navigation links can be opened in ECP.
{% endhint %}

To learn more about extension APIs, refer to the relevant [developers documentation](../../ext-apps/overview-of-extension-api/).
